Fertilizer is any material of natural (organic fertilizers) or synthetic (inorganic, chemical or mineral fertilizers) origin that is supplied to soil or to plant tissues 
in order to provide nutrients - food for crops, or building blocks for plant body. The most widely spread form of industrially manufactured fertilizers is spherical or 
irregularly shaped granule. The quality of a commercially available fertilizer is measured by a number of parameters. Among the most important features are chemical 
content and granulometric composition. Generally, commercial batches of inorganic fertilizers are randomly tested along supply chain to monitor its consistence against 
declared specifications. In some cases, there is a need in alternative rapid test of a product, due to lack of resources (financial and temporal) for a proper laboratory 
inspection. As such, measurement of particle sizes distribution based on visual analysis of digital images of fertilizer granules, might become a helpful tool for 
inspectors, managers and farmers.
